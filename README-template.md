## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned
In this project I could practice CSS for design. Specifically it was helpfull with inner and outer border radius. All CSS was written in an external file. 

In HTML used absolute and relative positions for centering the elements in any dimension. 
I could also practice other aspects such as including images, links and favicons.

### Continued development

In future projects I would practice flexbox and grid for positioning elements and media queries for responsive websites.
